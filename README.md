#### Features:

1. **Adding Tasks:**
   - Users can add new tasks by entering a title and description in the input fields.
   - Upon clicking the "Add" button, the new task is added to the list and saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring persistence across sessions.

2. **Editing Tasks:**
   - Each task has an "Edit" button that allows users to modify the task title and description.
   - An edit form appears within the task item, enabling users to update the details and save them.

3. **Completing Tasks:**
   - Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking the check icon.
   - Completed tasks are moved to a separate list and timestamped with the completion date and time.

6. **Local Storage:**
   - Tasks and completed tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring data persistence even after the page is refreshed.

### Key Technologies and Components:

- **React Hooks:** Utilizes `useState` for state management and `useEffect` for side effects, such as loading tasks from local storage.
- **CSS Styling:** The app is styled using CSS to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
- **Icons:** Uses icons from `react-icons` for interactive elements like delete, edit, and complete actions.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures the app is responsive and usable on different screen sizes by adjusting the layout and dimensions.

### How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the development server using `npm start`.

This ToDo application showcases the power of React in building interactive and user-friendly web applications. Enjoy exploring the project and happy coding!








# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
